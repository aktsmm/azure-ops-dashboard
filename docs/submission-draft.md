### Project Description (250 words max)

**Azure Ops Dashboard** is a desktop GUI application that reads a live Azure environment and generates architecture diagrams and AI-powered operational reports — all from a single click.

**The Problem:** Enterprise teams managing Azure subscriptions lack a quick way to visualize their environment and get actionable security/cost insights without juggling multiple portals, CLI commands, and manual documentation.

**The Solution:** Azure Ops Dashboard connects to Azure Resource Graph, inventories every resource, and produces:

- **Draw.io diagrams** (`.drawio`) — inventory overview and network topology views with Azure-official icons, auto-detected VNet/Subnet hierarchy, and deterministic layout
- **Security reports** — secure score, Defender status, recommendations, and risk analysis
- **Cost reports** — spend breakdown by service/resource group, optimization proposals, and Advisor integration
- **Diff reports** — automatic comparison with previous runs to track environment drift

Reports are generated by the **GitHub Copilot SDK**, which streams AI analysis enriched with Microsoft Learn documentation references. Users can customize report templates (section ON/OFF, custom instructions) and switch between Japanese and English at runtime.

**Key Technical Highlights:**
- GitHub Copilot SDK for multi-step AI reasoning (review → report → diff)
- Dynamic model selection from available Copilot models
- Microsoft Learn Search API integration for document-grounded reports
- Thread-safe streaming UI with atomic buffer swaps
- PyInstaller packaging for single-exe distribution
- Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- 32 unit tests runnable without Azure/SDK connectivity

Built entirely with GitHub Copilot assistance — from architecture design through implementation, debugging, and code review.

### Primary Programming Language

Python

### Key Technologies Used

- GitHub Copilot SDK (`github-copilot-sdk`) — AI report generation and environment review
- Azure CLI / Azure Resource Graph — resource inventory and data collection
- tkinter — cross-platform desktop GUI
- Microsoft Learn Search API — document enrichment for AI-generated reports
- python-docx / comtypes — Word/PDF export
- Draw.io (mxfile XML) — architecture diagram generation
- PyInstaller — Windows .exe packaging
- i18n — runtime Japanese/English switching

### Submission Type

Individual

### Quick Setup Summary

```powershell
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/aktsmm/azure-ops-dashboard.git
cd azure-ops-dashboard
uv venv
uv pip install -e ".[ai]"

# Prerequisites: Azure CLI logged in
az login
az extension add --name resource-graph

# Run
uv run python main.py
```

### Technical Highlights

1. **Copilot SDK streaming pipeline**: The app spawns a background thread that calls the Copilot SDK asynchronously. AI output is streamed token-by-token into the tkinter UI via atomic buffer swaps (replacing `list.clear()` with attribute rebinding to avoid race conditions between the writer thread and the 100ms UI poll timer).

2. **Microsoft Learn enrichment**: Before generating reports, the app queries Microsoft Learn Search API and a static reference map to inject grounded documentation URLs into the AI prompt — reducing hallucination and providing actionable links.

3. **Deterministic diagram layout**: The Draw.io generator uses a priority-ordered type list (LAYOUT_ORDER) to place resources in a consistent Region → VNet → Subnet hierarchy with Azure-official SVG icons. No random positioning — same input always produces the same diagram.

4. **Template system with user override**: Report templates (JSON) are bundled but can be overridden in `%APPDATA%\AzureOpsDashboard\templates\` without rebuilding the .exe. This "bundled + user override" pattern was a key design learning.

5. **Diff reports**: Each report run automatically finds the previous report and generates a structured diff, enabling environment drift tracking over time.

### Challenges & Learnings

- **Thread safety in tkinter**: Discovered that `StringVar.get()` from a background thread is unsafe even under GIL. Solution: capture all GUI values in the UI thread before spawning workers.
- **Copilot SDK timeout handling**: `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` timeouts leaked running coroutines. Added explicit `future.cancel()` on timeout.
- **PyInstaller resource paths**: `Path(__file__).parent` breaks in frozen executables. Created `app_paths.py` to abstract `sys._MEIPASS` fallback.
- **High-frequency `root.after()` calls**: Streaming AI output via per-token `after(0, ...)` caused UI freezes. Batched to 100ms polling with atomic buffer swap.
