## 概要

🚀 Starting Today: GitHub Copilot SDK Enterprise Challenge (Q3 FY26)

Open to: All FTEs
Goal: showcase customer-oriented, enterprise grade use cases built with the GitHub Copilot SDK.

The GitHub Copilot SDK represents a major shift in how organizations can apply AI to software delivery. While Copilot started as an "in-the-IDE" assistant that helps individual developers write code faster, the SDK lets customers (and partners) embed the same agentic core that powers Copilot CLI into their own apps. That means the agent capabilities we use to help teams across the SDLC can now be used by customers to build their own agents and workflows, tailored to their tools and processes.

We're kicking off a three-week challenge to build and showcase the most compelling, production-ready solutions for the enterprise — from agents and workflows to full applications and integrations. Submit your solutions by Mar 7th, and winners will be announced in Apr.

## 🔧 What you'll build

Your submission must include:

- A short summary of your project (150 words max)
- A video of the solution in action (3 mins max)
- Working solution with code in a GitHub repo, with README, architecture diagram, and setup instructions
- Presentation deck with 1-2 slides, including business value proposition and architecture diagram. Please include the link to your repo in the deck.

The GitHub Repo must include:

- `/src` or `/app` (working code)
- `/docs` (README with problem→solution, prereqs, setup, deployment, architecture diagram, RAI notes)
- `AGENTS.md` (custom instructions) and `mcp.json` for any MCP servers
- Demo deck (`/presentations/YourSolutionName.pptx`) or link to public ready post
- Optional: `/customer` folder with signed testimonial release.

To win bonus points, you may also include:

- **Product Feedback**: Share product feedback on GHCP SDK in the SDK team channel, e.g. documentation, bugs, new feature requests
- **Validation with customer**: Submit a customer testimonial release form. If you can't get a signed testimonial form, please upload a document indicating you have validated this with the customers.

## FAQ

### How big can the teams be?

You can team up to 3 people. We encourage teams with people from across Solution Areas and Solution Plays to encourage a more diverse solution!

### Can I submit more than once?

A team can submit multiple entries, and you can join more than one team. In the event that you do win multiple times, you will only receive one winner badge and one coaching session. Please include all team members' contacts in your submission.

### When does riffing become plagiarism?

Be transparent about your work and ensure license compatibility. Document what code you started with and what you added, so judges can easily see your contributions. Submissions should offer substantial new features or elements, not just minor changes or edits.

### What happens if my submission is considered plagiarized or invalid?

Anything deemed to be plagiarism will not be eligible for prizes.

### Do submissions have to be in English?

We encourage you to submit in English but we will not be judging on mastery of the English language, so please don't let this deter you from submitting.

### Can there be ties?

During the screening stage, each submission will be scored and ranked based on total points. If there is a tie among the top three teams, the screeners will take a closer look and rescore the tied submissions to break the tie. The final three teams will then advance to the final round, where they will be ranked by the judges.

### How will I know if I won?

Top three teams will be contacted at the end of the screening period and will get a chance to present and answer Q&A in a final judging panel with Microsoft and GitHub Engineering and Business leads. The final ranking will be announced in Viva Engage and other channel (Teams/Email).
